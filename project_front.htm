		<h2>About me</h2>
		<p>
			Hello! My name is Jalynn Hicks and I’m 18 currently attending <strong>Owen’s Community College</strong> as a freshman. I’m aiming for an associate degree in Computer Programming Technology. One of the courses that I decided to take was IST 126, a course that covers the basics of html/css. <strong>Html (hypertext markup language)</strong> is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. <strong>CSS (cascading style sheets)</strong> is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language such as HTML.
		</p>
		<p>
			So what specifically is web design? Web design encompasses many different skills and disciplines in the production and maintenance of websites. There are many things you learn from just the basics of web design, such as:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li><em>How to use External links</em></li>
			<li><em>How to tables</em></li>
			<li><em>How you can use Lorem Ipsum (dummy text)</em></li>
			<li><em>And much, much more!</em></li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Anyone can easily get into web design, not matter whether you’re young, old, or what have you. I hope you can find this website helpful and resourceful for your html/css needs!
