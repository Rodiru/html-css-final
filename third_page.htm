		<h2>Tables</h2>
		<p>
			A table is a structured set of data made up of rows and columns (tabular data). A table allows you to quickly and easily look up values that indicate some kind of connection between different types of data, for example a person and their age, or a day of the week, or the timetable for a local swimming pool.
		</p>
		<p>
			The HTML tables are created using the table tag in which the tr tag is used to create table rows and td tag is used to create data cells. The elements under td are regular and left aligned by default. Down below is an example of a table.
		</p>
		
		<table>
		<thead>
			<tr>
				<th>Month</th>
				<th>Savings</th>
				<th>insurance</th>
				<th rowspan="3">Savings for holiday!</th>
			</tr>
			<br>
		</thead>
		<tbody>
			<tr>
				<td>January</td>
				<td>$100</td>
				<td>$50</td>
				<td rowspan="0">$650</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>February</td>
				<td>$80</td>
				<td>$35</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>March</td>
				<td>$200</td>
				<td>$40</td>
