		<h2>External Links</h2>
		<p>
			A website is a collection of interconnected web pages. Links creation are an essential part of web design. Links creation properly utilizes the content and reduce the effort for repetition of content. Links can be used to interconnect two different web pages or it may be used as  HTML hyperlinks to go to some other URL or we can use a link to navigate in the same web page.
		</p>
		<h2>Internal Links</h2>
		<p>
			An internal link is used in html page to navigate properly in the webpage. If you want to go to any specific location in the same page by clicking on a link, you can create an internal link in the webpage. <a> tag is used for link creation in html page.
